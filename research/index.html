                <p>When you look out of the window on a sunny day, what do you see? There are some standard answers: We see features (e.g., color and motion), objects (e.g., trees and cars), and scenes (e.g., grass fields and buildings). At the same time, your visual impressions are much richer than that: You may see a tree not just as green, but as beautiful; you may see a metal can not just as reflective, but as crushed; and you may see a person walking by not only as moving leftward, but as avoiding someone. How do these impressions arise? And why do we have these impressions? Our lab researches the mechanisms and functions of human's rich perceptual experiences.</p>

                <div class="section-header">Aesthetic Perception</div>

                <p>It can be hard to see things without also liking or disliking them to some degree. Here in our lab, we are curious about this pervasive aspect of our perceptual experiences. In several behavioral and modeling projects, we look into this kind of everyday aesthetic experiences. We ask a series of questions, such as: Why do we like some of the things we see and not others? How much deliberation is needed to experience different kinds of beauty? Beyond aesthetic <em>judgments</em>, is there aesthetic <em>perception</em>? How and why people differ in their aesthetic tastes? To answer these questions, we explore all sorts of topics, including visual perspective, sound preference, action, face perception, and spatial representation. Here are a few studies from our lab related to this topic:</p>

                <div class="section-header">Causality and Naive Physics</div>

                <p>Central to human intelligence is the desire and ability to understand causality, and thus, more and more researchers are exploring human causal reasoning. In our lab, we study causal representations from a different perspective, asking questions such as: Before a person starts to reason about causal information, how do our visual systems already start extracting causality? How much do mechanisms for perceiving physical events and social events overlap? How does causal perception interact with other mental processes? A unique topic we look at is how we can “see history”: When we see a dented can, our visual systems may represent the past physical process that caused an undamaged can to become dented! </p>

                <div class="section-header">Social Perception</div>
                <p>What often occupies our minds the most in everyday experience is other people, and accordingly there is the whole area of social psychology dedicated to understanding our social experiences. In our lab, we integrate these explorations into the study of perception by asking how visual processing is directly involved in extracting other people’s social intentions. In particular, we focus on everyday phenomena that are familiar yet rarely or never studied. For example, one of our favorites is the awkward interaction of “gaze deflection”: When one person is surreptitiously looking at another person, and suddenly looks away when they are caught staring. As it turns out, visual perception plays an integral role in our understanding of this social situation!</p>
